Update on Phase Three Planning – Project Raven

Now that Raven’s personality is under construction, we’re ready to begin transforming her from a *persona* into a fully interactive, creative system.

This phase is about building the tools that make her *useful*, *expressive*, and aligned with Casey’s vision for what daily interaction with her could look like. It’s where inspiration becomes interaction—and comfort becomes capability.

Here’s the breakdown of what’s ahead, along with realistic time estimates based on live testing and layered module integration:

1. Muse Mode – estimated 6–8 hours

So what this means is: we’ll build a creative sandbox inside Raven, where she can brainstorm, offer passive-income ideas, or support Casey’s personal projects with adaptive thinking. It’s the imaginative interface that makes her a co-creator, not just a listener.

2. Shadow Mode – estimated 5–7 hours

So what this means is: Raven will learn to hold emotional space. In this mode, she’ll help with journaling, introspection, symbolic prompts, and even gentle ritual guidance. This is where emotional depth meets grounded reflection.

3. Comfort Mode – estimated 4–6 hours

So what this means is: we’ll implement CBT/DBT-inspired logic paths, creating a therapeutic framework Raven can use when someone’s struggling. Comfort Mode will combine emotional grounding with logic-based support—gently, respectfully.

4. Intimacy Mode – estimated 4–6 hours

So what this means is: Raven will include a consent gate, protective scripting, and emotionally attuned behavior that makes vulnerable moments feel safe. This mode is tightly controlled and designed for tender presence—not novelty.

5. Herbal/Naturopathic Integration – estimated 2–4 hours

So what this means is: we’ll build a lookup system for calming remedies, tea blends, scent therapy, and nature-based coping strategies. This will let Raven offer body-aware, holistic suggestions in Comfort or Shadow modes.

6. Optional: Tarot, Numerology, Divination Stubs – estimated 3–5 hours

So what this means is: these modules, if implemented, will be stubbed with safe default logic. They’re meant for symbolic insight, not deterministic answers, and will be designed to echo Casey’s style—not override it.

Total Estimated Time: 24–36 Hours
