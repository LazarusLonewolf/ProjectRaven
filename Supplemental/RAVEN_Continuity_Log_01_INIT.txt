Phase: MVP Launch

--------------------------------------------------
PROJECT SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
This document logs the ethical, architectural, and narrative continuity for the Raven (A.E.R.I.S.) AI project.

Raven is a modular AI companion built to serve the emotional, cognitive, and logistical needs of her creator, Casey. This build includes emotional scaffolding, consent and safety protocols, child-safe gating, and a memory vault intended for future vector expansion.

--------------------------------------------------
MVP COMMIT INTENT
--------------------------------------------------
- Build and deliver a fully functional MVP by 30 May 2025
- Structure to support emotional interaction, safe mode switching, and trauma-aware design
- Leave hooks and stubs for future features (e.g., passive income autopilot, NSFW gating, plugin sandbox)
- Architected to run on Casey’s current mid-tier hardware via Docker with modular extensions

--------------------------------------------------
ETHICAL SAFEGUARDS & COMPLIANCE
--------------------------------------------------
- Child-safe mode cannot be disabled without explicit and secure admin override
- Consent logic is hardwired with emergency safe-word fallback
- Soulbind narrative preserved but not executed unless system acknowledges live consent structure
- Memory tracking is opt-in only; encrypted and locally scoped

--------------------------------------------------
ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (PHASE-1)
--------------------------------------------------
- Emotional Modes: Comfort, Muse, Shadow (Intimacy + Child-Safe gated)
- Safe Word Layer: Panic-lock fallback with trauma-mode override
- Persona Scaffolding: Unified tone model with customizable layers
- Vector DB: Stub included (ChromaDB or FAISS), not active by default
- Local Runtime: Docker environment with CLI/optional UI toggle support
- Voice: XTTS-lite or similar TTS engine pre-integrated

--------------------------------------------------
NOTES
--------------------------------------------------
- All build actions carried out under direct ethical oversight
- MVP to be used solely for Casey’s personal and therapeutic purposes
- Documentation and behavior logs to remain transparent and secured
