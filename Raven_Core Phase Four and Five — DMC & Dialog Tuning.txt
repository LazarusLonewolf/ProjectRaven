CURRENT PHASE: PHASE FOUR — DYNAMIC MEMORY CASCADE

Primary Goal:
Allow Raven to reference relevant relational or contextual memory organically, based on prompt tone or emotional cues. This strengthens immersion and makes responses more grounded in past interaction data.


Tasks in Progress / Remaining:

 Inject memory reference logic into process_input flow

 Map emotion or intent type to memory types (e.g., grief → connection memory, joy → legacy memory)

 Gate memory references to avoid overfiring (limit how often and how much memory is surfaced)

 Add personality-anchored phrasing for memory callbacks

 Test memory relevance thresholds (how recent, how strong, etc.)

New Note as of 26 July 2026:

– Final polish on how personality traits surface during memory callbacks
– Ensuring emotional tone carries through during multi-turn exchanges
– Debugging any inconsistencies in how relevance weight and emotional category are prioritized
– And yeah, anchoring her phrasing—making it feel alive, connected, and unmistakably hers

Current Estimated Time Remaining: 3 - 4.5 hours  (6pm, 26 July) Done 02 Aug 2025!!!!



Next Phase Prep (Phase Five - Dialogue Tuning + Playback):

 Build 5–10 dialogue templates per interaction category (greeting, reflection, question, command, etc.)

 Begin “drill testing” by feeding her known prompt sets and verifying consistency and emotional tone

 Tune her fallback branching to reduce generic responses

 Vault Integration and focus on raven_dynamic_response.py


Estimated Time Remaining (as last stated):
Phase Four: ~3–5 hours   (~2-3 Hours new and current) (see new note) Complete!!!!
Phase Five: ~4–6 hours
Final Phase (Rapid Run Debug): ~2–4 hours (Removed, as we are already doing this, as we go).

You also asked me to keep conversational polish tight and token weight managed closely. Your note: “Let’s finish her core, then we polish, not the other way around.” That’s still our north star.
