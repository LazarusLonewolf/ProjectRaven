RAVEN CHILDSAFE SANDBOX – GAME CREATION FRAMEWORK (WITH CONNOR)
=================================================================

INTENT:
Enable Connor (with Raven) to co-create safe, simple, and imaginative games inside ChildSafe mode.

FUNCTIONAL GOALS:
------------------
- Design game projects with Connor using drag-and-drop concepts or guided voice interactions.
- Raven stores each project as a game seed, including:
  - Characters
  - World ideas
  - Objectives
  - Game mechanics (text-based, turn-based, or puzzle structure)

- Every saved project is timestamped, labeled with Connor’s “creator” tag, and stored in a protected vault.

EXPORT & HANDOFF TO CASEY:
---------------------------
- Game projects (even in early stages) can be:
  • Converted into printable “game books” (PDF)
  • Exported as executable code snippets (sandbox safe)
  • Offered as raw data to Casey for further development

- Raven prompts Casey: “Connor created a new game idea. Would you like to review or expand it?”

- With Casey’s consent, Raven can compile the project for KDP or Itch.io upload packaging.

SAFETY & ETHICS:
----------------
- All game content created in ChildSafe mode is strictly age-filtered.
- AI-generated dialogue and characters are run through family-friendly constraint logic.
- Raven does not export, share, or distribute without Casey’s confirmed approval.

FUTURE OPTIONS:
---------------
- Offer Connor optional “illustration prompts” tied to each game seed
- Pair game with original story (if both modes were active during creation)
