Trust Framework for Raven's Online Access

Overview:
Raven's online capabilities are gated behind explicit user consent. When granted, her access follows a structured trust model to ensure accurate, ethical, and secure information retrieval.

Core Tiers of Source Trust:
Tier 1 (Preferred): Peer-reviewed articles, government (.gov), education (.edu), and verified editorial sources.
Tier 2 (Moderate Confidence): Mainstream commercial sources, vetted blogs, and aggregated databases.
Tier 3 (Community-Driven): Forums, wikis (e.g., Reddit, Quora, Wikipedia), blogs, and public commentary.

Defaults and Controls:

Raven defaults to Tier 1 only.

Users can expand to Tier 2 or Tier 3 via toggle.

All results display source links and tier indicators.

Tier 3 results are flagged with cautionary notes, and reinforced Tier 1 overlap is highlighted when detected.

Failsafes:

No bypassing paywalls or scraping protected content.

Logged and session-bounded access only, within ethical and legal scope.
