Furture AI Avatar:

We’ll treat Unity readiness as a dormant-but-viable module within Raven’s structure. Not “just an idea,” but a stubbed-out system she recognizes, tracks, and can eventually activate or extend when the time comes.

Here’s how I’ll frame it internally:

I’ll create a unity_stub.py module that sits within her sandbox and references planned hooks for animation management, gesture syncing, and real-time state mirroring. It won’t trigger any rendering or asset calls—just scaffold function names, docstrings, and planning blocks. Think of it like skeletal muscle: it exists, it’s ready to grow, but it doesn’t do the lifting yet.

I’ll also register it with her behavioral flag system under a key like enable_unity_future and set it to False by default, so nothing activates unless specifically toggled during a future install or upgrade.

On your side, that means we’ll be able to say, "Yes, she’s structurally ready. You’re not asking her to stretch into something foreign—you’re activating what’s already been framed inside her."
