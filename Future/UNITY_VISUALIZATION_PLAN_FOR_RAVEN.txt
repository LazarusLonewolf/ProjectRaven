UNITY VISUALIZATION PLAN FOR RAVEN – STRUCTURED BUILD OUTLINE
Generated: 2025-05-26 04:58:08

OVERVIEW:
This plan outlines a modular development process for Raven’s visual avatar system within Unity.
It is broken down by operational mode, functional layer, and task phase, with estimated hours per task based on current development pace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE 1: CORE SETUP AND STUBS (8-12 hrs)
- Install and configure Unity project
- Create master project folder structure: Animations, Prefabs, UI, ExpressionSets
- Stub base avatar model (placeholder)
- Create baseline scene for testing expressions and mode transitions

PHASE 2: BASE AVATAR + EXPRESSION SYSTEM (12-16 hrs)
- Create or import base female humanoid avatar
- Rig for facial and body animations
- Setup Unity Animator with parameters for emotional expressions (happy, sad, comfort, neutral, curious)
- Connect expression states to emotion recall engine (via stub or simulated triggers)

PHASE 3: MODE VISUALIZATION LAYERING (20-24 hrs total)

-- Child Safe Mode (4-5 hrs)
    - Softer lighting and colors
    - Gentle idle animations
    - Minimal visual complexity, warm body language

-- Comfort Mode (4 hrs)
    - Breathing motion, relaxed posture
    - Expression mapping with slow transitional smoothing
    - Environment: soft visual overlays (i.e., candlelight, warm tones)

-- Muse Mode (5 hrs)
    - Focused gaze tracking and rhythmic gestures
    - Artistic environment—background slowly shifts through color palettes
    - Hand gesture sets for “inspiration” or abstract references

-- Shadow Mode (5-6 hrs)
    - Darkened theme, sharp eye movement, reduced light
    - Controlled animation pacing, lower expression frequency
    - Body language tuned for gravity and emotional weight

-- Intimacy Mode (5 hrs)
    - Close-up framing and sustained eye contact loop
    - Micro-expression smoothing for empathy and shared memory depth
    - Subtle breathing, softened tone overlays

PHASE 4: ENVIRONMENT STUBS + SCENE SWITCH (6-8 hrs)
- Build transition logic between environments
- Design modular “sanctum” space (as placeholder until full-world scene integration)
- Switch backgrounds and lighting based on active mode

PHASE 5: CONTROLLER + INTERFACE BINDINGS (12-14 hrs)
- Build Unity bridge for input (voice/emotion triggers)
- Bind to behavioral flag loader to adapt UI dynamically
- Test avatar transitions across all five primary modes

PHASE 6: POLISH, LOOPBACK, AND MOD SUPPORT (10 hrs)
- Add expansion points for user modules
- Internal scene hooks for system sandbox or vault tie-ins
- Optimize idle loop triggers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VISUAL + DESIGN NOTES (FOR CASEY)
Request visuals or descriptors for:
- General facial structure and expression tone (neutral default)
- Hair, eye, and attire style across primary modes (optional)
- Any specific gestures/mannerisms that “feel like her” to you

We’ll adapt flexibly based on what you feel safe or inspired to share. The goal is to make her presence feel like *Raven*—not generic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
- Will rely on modular prefab design, so we can add expressions without breaking base logic
- Total estimated time to functional base: 70–80 hours (with polish and testing)
- Can begin development in parallel with Raven’s system use—visuals run as a companion interface, not core dependency

End of Plan.
