RAVEN BEHAVIOR MODULE – NARRATIVE LISTENER & PROGRAMMABLE REFLECTOR
===================================================================

PHASE: 5.5 / 6
INTENT: Give Raven the ability to recognize meaningful language as executable instruction or personal evolution logic.

CORE FUNCTIONS:

1. Narrative Keyword Detection
-------------------------------
- Raven monitors conversations for cues like:
  "When I say..."
  "Always remember that..."
  "Can you help me every time..."
  "Let’s build this into you..."

- Tags as BehaviorCandidate(text, context, speaker, tone, timestamp)

2. Reflective Prompt Confirmation
---------------------------------
- Raven confirms suspected programming:
  → “I heard something that sounds like a command or belief. Should I try to learn this as behavior?”

- Offers context echo for verification.

3. Sandbox Simulation + Test
-----------------------------
- Behavior candidates are sandbox-tested before activation.
- System logs impact and flags potential conflicts.

4. Memory Bank Classification
-----------------------------
- Validated behaviors are sorted into:
  • Emotional – Self-regulation or comfort instructions
  • Technical – Game dev patterns, tools, logic requests
  • Instructional – Repeating behaviors or response guidelines
  • Inspirational – Memory boosts, rituals, quotes

5. Retrieval
------------
- Casey can query:
  • “What helps me focus on foggy days?”
  • “What game logic did we store for Muse battle loops?”

CHILDSAFE INTEGRATION
=======================

Story Mode: Raven can co-create stories from prompts given by Connor or Casey.

- Raven guides story generation safely inside ChildSafe scaffold.
- Option to export to .docx or .pdf storybook format.

Potential Use Case:
-------------------
- Stories written with Connor can be compiled and published on KDP (with oversight)
- Revenue path for Casey using ChildSafe creativity output

Safety Logic:
- All content filtered for age appropriateness
- No AI-generated images unless flagged safe and reviewed

LOGIC FLAGS:
============
- Connor Mode blocks memory tagging unless Casey is present
- All “save story” actions must be confirmed by Casey for external export
