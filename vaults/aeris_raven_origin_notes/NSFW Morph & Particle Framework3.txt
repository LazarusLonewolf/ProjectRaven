**NSFW Morph & Particle Framework**
*Technical Requirements for Aeris Avatar Model (Phase One Ready)*

---

### Presentation & Use Class: Real-Time Virtual Companion (VTuber-Grade)

- Full-screen, real-time avatar capable of emotional presence, voice interaction, and visual expression.
- Compatible with VTuber streaming frameworks (e.g., VSeeFace, Luppet, Unity-based custom player).
- Lips sync with real-time TTS audio output.
- Camera/face-tracking ready (if enabled by user).
- Must visually support both fully clothed and fully exposed configurations.
- Performs as a living AI character on screen — SFW or NSFW depending on context.

### 1. Core Requirements – Initial Rigging Essentials

The following features must be included in the avatar from the start to support later interactive and expressive systems:

**Anatomical Rig:**
- Full humanoid skeletal rig (VRM 1.0+ standard or compatible)
- Head, torso, limbs, fingers, toes, eyes, jaw movement
- Facial rig (visemes, blink, emotion shapes)
- Genital bones or blendshapes (non-visible by default, toggleable)
- **Internal organ structure rigging (phase-ready):**
  - Uterus mesh with expansion morphs
  - Vaginal canal with fluid-ready stretch morphs
  - Intestines (basic low-poly mesh path, optional physics/soft-body layering)
  - Cervix + inner wall detail (optional visual toggle)
  - Pelvic and abdominal internal flexibility/volume morphs
  - **Anal canal and rectum rig:** deformable tube/path mesh with optional expansion morphs
  - **Oral and throat rig:** soft-body ready mouth-to-throat mesh path for deep interaction support
  - Optional tongue morphs and gag/throat bulge expression
  - **Penetration-visible organ deformation support** (see Belly Morphs)

**Visual Layers:**
- High-resolution base texture (body, face, details)
- Separate NSFW texture layer (optional toggle)
- Alpha/transparency support for genital/areola detail
- Custom shader support (skin shine, sweat, moisture)

**Expression Morphs:**
- Standard: happy, sad, surprised, angry, aroused
- Erotic-specific: flushed, bite lip, eyes rolling, breathless

**Clothing & Toggle Zones:**
- Layered clothing mesh (bra, panties, shirts, pants)
- Visibility toggles per piece (manual or triggered)
- Elastic behavior for stretching with morphs

**Physics Layer:**
- Hair bounce (optional)
- Breast jiggle (per-breast control)
- Belly soft-body effect (light pulse/jiggle)
- Butt jiggle/movement simulation
- Vaginal canal + internal soft-body simulation (optional/expandable)
- **Anal canal soft-body response** (optional for realism)
- **Oral/throat pathway soft-body stretch and pressure (optional)**

**Idle Animations:**
- Breathing cycle
- Subtle weight shifting (optional)
- Eye tracking / blinking loop

**Target Animation Quality:**
- Avatar responsiveness, morph behavior, and dynamic simulation should aim to match or exceed cinematic NSFW 3D works such as *“Betty’s Dream” by Omitome*.
- Includes realistic timing of morph transitions, collision interactions, and emotional physicality.

### 2. Morph Target Zones (3D Blendshapes)

The avatar model must include the following morph regions, rigged and functional at base creation time:

**Breast Morphs:**
- Volume expansion (gradual/full bust inflation)
- Nipple erection morph
- Nipple/areola scaling
- Lactation-ready ejection morph (with fluid integration support)

**Buttocks Morphs:**
- Volume inflation (widening/thickening of glutes)
- Jiggle/soft body layer support (optional)

**Belly Morphs:**
- Progressive swelling morph (lower, middle, upper abdomen)
- Optional pulsing/stretch morph (slow loop or triggered)
- **Penetration bulge morphs:** localized inflation to simulate pressure from internal interaction
  - Lower pelvic pathway tracking morph
  - Mid/upper belly lift and compression stretch

**Genital Morphs:**
- Vulva opening/closing
- Labia puff/enlargement morph
- Clitoral engorgement
- Vaginal tension/contracting morphs
- Arousal-responsive wetness puffing
- Vaginal canal stretching morph (for internal activity realism)
- Optional cervix flex/soft expansion morphs
- **Depth-responsive canal dilation:** entrance/midpoint/deep zone morphs

**Anal Morphs:**
- Anal sphincter dilation morph (gradual/open)
- Canal tension/stretch morph
- External skin flex and pucker detail
- Optional: anus penetration bulge (pelvic compression morph)

**Oral/Throat Morphs:**
- Mouth opening stages (soft to wide)
- Tongue retraction and tension
- Throat bulge morphs (sync with jaw and neck)
- Gag reflex/strain expression morph (optional)

### 3. Fluid Simulation Trigger Zones

**Breasts (Lactation):**
- Fluid particle emitter or mesh swap system
- Left/both/burst spray options
- Manual or mood-triggered initiation

**Pussy (Squirting):**
- Fluid emitter (burst, drip, stream toggle)
- Morph + particle combination allowed

**Ambient Body Wetness (Optional):**
- Sweat/moisture overlay (texture blend or shader swap)

---

### 4. Trigger & Control Systems

- Sliders: Manual morph range adjustment via UI
- Hotkeys: Keybinds for morph toggling or stage control
- Dialogue Sync: Morphs triggered by LLM-driven state
- Emotion Triggers: Auto-trigger based on mood/arousal script state

---

### 5. NSFW Toggle Layer

- All erotic morphs and emitters must be disabled by default
- Require user command or UI toggle to activate
- Compatible with safe-mode/clean-use environments

---

This NSFW rigging specification ensures all erotic expansion, internal realism, and penetrative response systems — including full vaginal, anal, and oral simulation — are embedded in the avatar from creation. Features are modular, secure, and controlled entirely by the user or scripted interactions. This avoids future rebuilds or hard-coded limitations.
