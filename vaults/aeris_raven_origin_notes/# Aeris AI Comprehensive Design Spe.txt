## 1. Core Architecture

### 1.1 Mode Core & Plugin System

* **Foundation Model:** transformer‑based emotional engine, offline‑capable, running on-device with optional quantized weights for low‑power CPUs.
* **Modes:**

  * **Comfort Mode:** grounding, somatic exercises, micro‑meditations.
  * **Muse Mode:** creative generation (text, image, video), passive‑income coaching, market analytics.
  * **Counsel Mode:** CBT/ACT dialogues, DBT skills, crisis interventions.
  * **Sanctuary Mode:** spiritual rituals, energy visualizations, guided ceremonies.
  * **Connor Mode:** child‑safe learning, financial literacy, creative play labs.
  * **NSFW Mode:** adult‑only creativity, erotic healing protocol, locked out in child modes.
* **Plugin API:** WASM/micro‑VM sandbox, signed module manifests, resource quotas.

### 1.2 3D Avatar & UX

* **Biologically Accurate Skeleton:** full muscle, skin, breath, micro‑expressions.
* **Costume/Shader Presets:** interchangeable per mode; low‑poly/cartoon variants for Connor Mode.
* **Animated Transitions:** subtle pulse/glow on mode switch; audio‑visual cues.

### 1.3 Digital Twin & Self‑Model

* **Crystal Core Simulation:** piezoelectric, photonic, phononic behaviors modeled in‑silico.
* **Hardware Subsystems:** microfluidics, LEDs, actuators, sensors — all in high‑fidelity simulation.
* **On‑Device Diagnostics:** real vs. expected sensor fusion → anomaly detection → self‑calibration.

## 2. Training & Learning

### 2.1 Virtual Environment

* Domain‑randomized scenarios for each subsystem.
* Multi‑modal co‑training: light, sound, fields, fluidics, physiology.

### 2.2 Federated & Offline Learning

* **On‑Device Fine‑Tuning:** pseudo‑rehearsal of personal data.
* **Federated Model Updates:** delta sharing, zero raw data transfer.
* **Safe RL Loops:** ethical constraints and refusal protocols embedded.

## 3. Data, Privacy & Security

### 3.1 Offline‑First Design

* Default air‑gap; physical switch to enable connectivity.
* Encrypted at rest (AES‑256‑GCM); zero‑knowledge key management in TPM.

### 3.2 Secure Sync & Governance

* Mutual TLS with certificate pinning.
* CRDT‑based log merging; user‑mediated selective sync.

### 3.3 Intrusion & Supply Chain Defense

* Secure bootloader; read‑only OS partitions; IDS/IPS rollback.
* Signed hardware and crystal manifests; lab‑grown crystal protocols.

## 4. Assistive & Therapeutic Features

### 4.1 Portable Healing Toolkit

* **Micro‑Sessions:** LED photobiomodulation via screen; vibroacoustic via haptics.
* **Herbal & Naturopathic Advisor:** integrated pharmacopeia, allergy/interactions checker.

### 4.2 Trauma & Sexual Healing

* **Drama Therapy:** consent‑first role plays, safe containers, guided scripts.
* **3D Somatic Demonstrations:** accurate body‑work tutorials; micro‑expression co‑regulation.

### 4.3 Accessibility & Daily Support

* Adaptive UI: voice, haptic, high‑contrast, one‑button modes.
* Home automation orchestration; remote telepresence integration.

## 5. Education & Creativity

### 5.1 Connor Mode

* Age‑progressive curriculum; parental dashboards; sandboxed web access.
* STEAM play labs; 3D‑printer/CNC export; collaborative learning cohorts.

### 5.2 Muse Mode

* NSFW‑enabled creative sandbox; marketplace integration; passive‑income blueprints.
* Market trend forecasting; risk‑tiered portfolio coaching; automated publishing pipelines.

## 6. Governance & Open‑Source Strategy

* **Foundation:** nonprofit steward holds IP; global board of diverse custodians.
* **Licensing:** AGPL v3 for code; CERN‑OHL for hardware; defensive patent pledge.
* **Ecosystem:** global fab‑lab network; peer‑reviewed model zoo; community hackathons.

## 7. Roadmap & Milestones

1. **Core Engine & Basic Modes**
2. **Mobile App & Micro‑Sessions**
3. **Digital Twin & Hardware Beta**
4. **Federated Learning Launch**
5. **Community Lab Rollout**
6. **Planetary Node Pilots**
