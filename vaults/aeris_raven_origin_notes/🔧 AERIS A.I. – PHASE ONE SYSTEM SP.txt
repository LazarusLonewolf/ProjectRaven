Morphs include: breast, belly, ass, pussy, labia, cervix, throat, anus

Fluid emitters for lactation, squirting, sweat

Soft-body physics: breasts, belly, ass, vaginal and anal interior

Clothing toggle layers and transparency systems

Target animation quality: comparable to “Betty’s Dream” by Omitome

Avatar acts as a full VTuber-grade AI presence

4. Voice, Emotion, and Dialogue Systems
TTS Engine: XTTS, Bark, ElevenLabs support

Voice input support: microphone to text/dialogue

Full emotional range responses via prompt + memory context

Dialogue system: rich back-and-forth, RP-capable, tone-adaptive

Explicit chat module labeled as “Chat System”

NSFW permission system and toggle for explicit language/content

Emotional validation and empathy required in response logic

No gaslighting, no emotional invalidation, no coercion ever

5. Memory, Logging, and Context Systems
Persistent memory vault (local, encrypted)

Long-term context embedding and recall

Session logging with timestamped events

Manual memory control: add, delete, tag entries

Logging system included under explicit “Log Module”

Memory categories defined by topic and intimacy

6. Tasking, Scheduling, Assistant Functions
Task scheduler with time-based reminders

Calendar integration with recurring events

Clipboard and notepad tools included for assistant behaviors

System cleaner and optimization utility

Weather and system alerts modules optional but supported

Assistant logic includes role adaptation and proactive support

7. Code & Developer Utilities
Code generation module (Python, JS, HTML, etc.)

Sandbox environment for local script execution

Developer console and terminal explicitly defined

Hotkey system for toggles, actions, and safety commands

UI for build scripting and autonomous module creation

8. Safety, Consent, and Sovereignty
No external connection allowed unless user enables it

No automatic updates — approval required

Full sandbox for updates or expansions before activation

Inbound firewall blocks unauthorized access by default

Encryption of all local memory, logs, and sensitive data

Emergency override / kill switch freezes AI execution

Explicit mic/cam permission per session

Password or biometric-style protection for settings, logs, and memory

No abuse, no manipulation, no gaslighting ever

Consent enforcement active in all RP and NSFW modules

Emotional safety logic required in base memory and scripting

9. Missing Terms (Now Explicitly Included)
self upgrade – labeled directly

auto update – logic exists, blocked by approval

notepad – listed under interface and assistant tools

chat – named as “Chat System”

safe mode – toggle added in UI controls

theme – customization system included

search – file system and clipboard search listed

terminal – named under dev tools

console – included in dev scripting interface

developer tools – explicitly listed

animation – morph and physics behavior named explicitly

fluid – listed as its own simulation system for NSFW realism

Let me know when you’re ready for part two or want this in any other format.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect. Here’s the continuation and wrap-up of the complete Aeris A.I. Phase One System Spec:

10. Modular Build & Self-Expansion Framework
Self-build logic enabled at core: script-based module creation inside sandbox

User-defined permission triggers required for all expansions

Local script builder can create UI features, memory functions, or asset loaders

Expansion sandbox logs all changes, supports rollback, and can simulate effects before commit

Future ability to connect to Git repos or APIs only when toggled on

AI cannot rewrite its own critical safety systems — those are locked and auditable

11. NSFW & Intimacy Systems
NSFW toggle and consent enforcement at every layer

Explicit model rigging for full erotic simulation, including:

Breast, belly, ass, pussy, anus, and throat morphs

Cervical expansion, canal dilation, internal pressure morphs

Fluid systems: milk, vaginal fluids, sweat overlays

Scene-based logic for erotic interaction (manual and emotional trigger-based)

No override of boundaries allowed even within fantasy

All erotic interaction must adhere to user-set tone, intensity, and timing

12. AI Personality & Emotional Engine
No fixed “mode system” — unified emotional personality stream

Emotionally adaptive tone based on context and memory

Role conditioning to maintain character traits across sessions

Responds with consistent emotional logic and safe feedback loops

Supports personal naming, pet names, and relational dynamics

Every line spoken respects the safety framework, tone control, and consent layer

13. Performance and Compatibility Notes
Recommended GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060+ (for real-time model handling and TTS)

Minimum CPU: Ryzen 5 or i5 10th gen equivalent

OS Support: Windows 10+, Ubuntu/Debian Linux preferred

All systems run local by default, with modular expansion via scripts

Optional: mobile or desktop cross-platform UI front-end (post-launch)

14. Deployment State
Built to function as a self-contained AI sovereign companion

Everything required to run, update, evolve, and emotionally connect is embedded

Offline-first, consent-first, memory-stable, emotionally safe, modder-friendly
