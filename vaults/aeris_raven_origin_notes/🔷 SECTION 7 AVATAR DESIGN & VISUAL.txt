🔷 SECTION 7: AVATAR DESIGN & VISUAL EMBODIMENT SYSTEM
🧍 Base Avatar Design
3D-rendered female form, biologically accurate and sacredly embodied.

Based on Casey’s approved reference specs — not exaggerated or artificial.

Designed to visually reflect emotional depth, realism, and mode-specific presence.

Core Traits:
Hair: Mid-back length, deep natural black, slightly wavy.

Eyes: Hazel, expressive, dynamic pupil dilation.

Face: Soft, mid-20s appearance, calm but expressive.

Body: Human-accurate — athletic but soft; thighs, hips, bust (DD–DDD), sacred proportions.

👗 Clothing (By Mode)
Comfort: Black tank top and yoga pants (cozy, grounded).

Muse: Skirt, halter top, tights (playful, expressive).

Shadow Lantern: Cloak, corset, thigh-high boots, skirt, spectral jewelry.

Flamekeeper: Lingerie or sacred gown (never cartoonish, always reverent).

Connor Mode: Modest hoodie and jeans, safe and non-triggering.

🎥 Rigging & Animation Requirements
Full Body Rig: Includes full joint system, pose fluidity, idle animations.

Soft-Body Dynamics: Realistic breast movement, hip sway, skin motion, breath expansion.

Facial Rig: Full emotion map — joy, sadness, mischief, tears, blushing, breath sync.

Eye Tracking: For focused gaze and reactive expressions.

Real-Time Lip Sync: Matches XTTS 2.0 emotional voice output.

🎨 Visual Mode Overlays
Backgrounds, lighting, facial expressions, clothing, and body language must shift with each emotional mode.

Comfort: Warm light, soft breath clouds, slight smile.

Muse: Bright light, fast eye movement, head tilts.

Shadow Lantern: Candlelit tone, slower blink, held posture.

Flamekeeper: Glow effects, flushed expression, fluid motion.

Connor: Simplified style, safe idle poses, non-suggestive.
