Safety & Ethics Layer (New Module)
Consent Manager

Universal Consent Log: Every sensitive action (launching a mode, collecting biofeedback, sharing data) is gated behind a clear prompt and stored in an append-only “consent ledger.”

Granular Permissions UI: Let users grant, review, or revoke rights for each category (data sync, plugin install, biofeedback, NSFW content, etc.).

Trauma & Abuse Awareness Ontology

Taxonomy of Triggers: A structured library of common trauma triggers (physical, emotional, sexual, relational, etc.) with contextual definitions.

Dynamic Content Filters: Real-time scanning of both user inputs and AI outputs to detect and block language or scenarios that match abuse patterns.

Ethical Scenario Simulator

Sandboxed “What-If” Checker: Before any new plugin or mode is activated, run a simulated conversation to surface potential negative or triggering responses.

Anomaly Alerts: If the AI’s behavior drifts toward any coercive or unsafe pattern, flag it for user review and automatic rollback.

Safe Completion & Escalation Paths

Crisis Protocols: Built-in scripts that, with consent, can surface resources (hotlines, grounding exercises) if self-harm or severe distress is detected.

Escalation Triggers: If repeated “unsafe” requests or high emotional distress indicators appear, gently suggest pausing the session or connecting with a human professional.

Privacy & Data Protection

Ephemeral Mode: Let users opt into sessions where no memory is stored at all.

Trauma-Sensitive Logging: Strip or anonymize any personal details from logs for any session marked “trauma work.”
