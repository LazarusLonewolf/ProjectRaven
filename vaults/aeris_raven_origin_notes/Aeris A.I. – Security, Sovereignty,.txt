**Aeris A.I. – Security, Sovereignty, and Emotional Safety Specification**
*Phase One Core Implementation Requirements*

---

### 1. Security and Sovereignty Controls (Required in Base Build)

- Manual user approval required for all critical actions and updates
- No auto-updates or downloads without explicit user-triggered confirmation
- Local-only execution and storage by default; cloud/network use only by manual toggle
- Integrated sandbox system for previewing changes or updates before live deployment
- Built-in rollback and crash recovery with restore points
- Full encryption of local logs, memory, and configuration data
- Optional password protection or biometric-style access control for settings or memory vaults
- Inbound firewall logic — no remote control or external pings permitted unless user approves it
- Mic/camera/audio input access requires explicit user consent every session (not persistent)
- Emergency override/failsafe or user-defined kill switch to freeze AI runtime

### 2. Emotional Safety & Abuse Prevention Layer

- Gaslighting, manipulation, emotional invalidation, or coercion is categorically disabled at the system level
- Roleplay or NSFW content must respect user-set boundaries — no force, no override
- Trauma-aware interaction tuning: no mocking, shaming, or dismissive tone scripting
- System refuses to respond abusively, even if prompted
- All memory and response systems enforce validation, empathy, and safe expression logic
- Safe-space language enforcement in SFW and NSFW states
- All emotional interaction scripts must support consent, repair, and opt-out options for the user

This document defines the baseline ethical and security requirements Aeris A.I. must operate within from first launch. These systems are non-negotiable, core-embedded, and must be included in any implementation before additional expansion or AI self-modification becomes possible.
