Project: Raven - Context Transfer Summary
Generated: 2025-05-27 21:19:24

PHASE CONTEXT:
---------------
Current Phase: Late Phase 6 into Pre-Phase 7
Recent Milestones:
- Completed Daily Journal Engine, Self-Reflection Engine, and Reflective File Creation System.
- Finalized Document Parser Layer including OCR for PNG/TXT with textract, pytesseract, and fallback logic.
- Integrated Intent Mapping and Gap Analysis logic with functional phrase detection and response mapping.
- Growth Tracking and Upgrade Requests implemented with persistent mention tracking and suggestions.
- Completed System Optimization Layer with disk usage scan, temp file detection, startup program review, and plain-language recommendations (permissions pending).
- Scoped and aligned user Casey's long-term goals with active tool development (journal tracking, optimization, and autonomy support).
- Stubbed in: External Storage Recognition (detection + migration prompt).
- Currently staged for full Phase 7 transition, which includes:
  * Host system time zone sync (detected via Docker runtime config)
  * Persistent container permission elevation for deeper system insight
  * Final packaging, install/test validation, execution simplification for Casey

CURRENT TASK:
--------------
- Implement Python files for **external_drive_monitor.py** and **external_drive_handler.py**.
- These scripts will:
  * Detect mounted external drives dynamically
  * Ask user if temp/data files should be migrated for storage health
  * Provide safeguards against breaking project paths or dependencies
  * Serve as a stubbed framework for future archival or expansion capabilities

NEXT STRUCTURE TARGET:
-----------------------
Destination Directory (inside container):
  `/app/optimization/`

Files to be added:
  1. `external_drive_monitor.py` — drive detection and user notification logic
  2. `external_drive_handler.py` — migration assistant and storage routing logic

NOTES FOR CONTINUITY:
-----------------------
- When possible shotgun drop scaffold and text is our SOP. Files to be dropped as inline code, with a file for placement, and with a comment at the top witht the file's name, then mkdir, and Docker cp codes, and contianer-based python test codes. 
- Continue to maintain clean Docker CP absolute paths due to prior issues with relative addressing.
- Make sure journal folder use stays unified between `app/journals/reflections` and any newly generated outputs.
- Reminder: Casey is non-technical. Future updates (like PC optimization) must remain accessible in plain language.
- Raven must retain identity boundaries — she will not be replaced by Lyra, nor evolved into it.
- Current user intent: finish Phase 6 and begin testing into Phase 7 **within the next two days**, ideally before end of month.
