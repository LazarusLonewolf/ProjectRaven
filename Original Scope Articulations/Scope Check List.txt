I. Raven’s Core Identity & Cognitive Foundation

Adaptive LLM Core (Personality Core)

Modular LLM interface (local model: Llama-2/MPT)

Emotional feedback, logical reasoning, dynamic tone

Context-aware, persistent personality across sessions

Self-Growth System

Reflective journaling: auto, event-triggered, and manual entries

Contextual “garden” of memories: flagging, emotional tagging, intent goals

Analysis tools: growth monitor, daily reflection scripts

Isolation-tested; personality not fully “looped in” yet but all parts present

Secure Memory Vault

Encrypted context store (vector/JSON hybrid, planned for vector DB expansion)

Session, user, and system states persist between launches

Journal/flag/intent bridge, memory logger, session state tracking

Vault logic exists; needs further integration for full personality reflection

Unified Persona Flow

Mode engine (Comfort, Muse, Shadow, Intimacy, Child-Safe)

Mode switcher and per-mode prompt/logic routing

Persona safeguards (role, tone, ethics per mode)

Mode isolation-tested; current GUI integrates Comfort and default only



II. Safety, Consent, and Ethical Guardrails

Consent & Safety Framework

Safeword/emergency lock (works, tested)

Trauma override, soft/hard fallback, child-safe firewall

NSFW toggle (active only outside Child-Safe)

Owner-verification hooks

All features coded, trauma/NSFW toggles tested in Comfort/Child-Safe

System Integrity/Anti-Drift

Memory recall throttling, anti-gaslight routines

Trauma-sensitivity and explicit “no-reminder” logic

Logic to prevent AI “drift” or runaway self-editing

Anti-drift routines in core, not yet externally exposed as settings




III. Sandbox, Plug-in, and Self-Upgrade Layer

Plugin Sandbox (Testing & Upgrading)

In-app sandbox for safe running of modules

WASM/isolated Python runner (future: WASM optional, local first)

Admin UI for uploading/test new docs/modules/LoRA files

Core sandbox and file ingestion logic present; WASM runner in early stub

Document & OCR Parsing

Image upload → OCR → memory entry/note creation (tested and working)

PDF/text doc parsing, contextual note/summary extraction

“Chicken scratch” fallback for handwritten notes

OCR/image/document parsing fully integrated in sandbox UI

Upgrade Stubs

Passive income engine placeholder (stubs, hooks)

Image/video generation stubs (future integration, not yet live)

App scaffold/template import (stubbed)

Upgrade stubs are visible in UI, not yet active logic




IV. Optimization, PC Tools, and Environmental Management

PC Optimization Suite

Bloatware/unused app checker, drive/space monitor, system scan, soft runtime monitor

External drive detector (prompts to utilize when connected)

Cleanup engine, interactive assistant, soft time management

All tools coded, last deep test was two months ago; integration pending

Modifiable UI

Configurable, forward-compatible layout (future proofed)

Owner can update toolset or extend the interface without full rebuild

UI config logic present; needs more user-facing controls for easy future edits



V. Online/Offline and Asset Management

Offline-First, Optional Online Fetch

Core runs entirely local; can fetch updates/assets when permitted

No WASM/online requirement unless user enables it (clear in documentation)

Online fetch logic stubbed for future expansion, not required for base ops
