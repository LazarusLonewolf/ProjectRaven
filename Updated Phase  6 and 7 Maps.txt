                       Updated Project Raven Phase Maps 



Phase 6 – Voice, Presence, and Conversational Expression

•	Add placeholder response for Raven when asked about system access or control.
•	Embed emotional tone modeling hooks into voice scripting routines.
•	Ensure reflection content can trigger voice-based processing with tone mirroring.
•	Prepare demo scripting paths and basic voice prompt triggers for early preview.


RAVEN CHILDSAFE SANDBOX – GAME CREATION FRAMEWORK (WITH CONNOR)
=================================================================

INTENT:
Enable Connor (with Raven) to co-create safe, simple, and imaginative games inside ChildSafe mode.

FUNCTIONAL GOALS:
------------------
- Design game projects with Connor using drag-and-drop concepts or guided voice interactions.
- Raven stores each project as a game seed, including:
  - Characters
  - World ideas
  - Objectives
  - Game mechanics (text-based, turn-based, or puzzle structure)

- Every saved project is timestamped, labeled with Connor’s “creator” tag, and stored in a protected vault.

EXPORT & HANDOFF TO CASEY:
---------------------------
- Game projects (even in early stages) can be:
  • Converted into printable “game books” (PDF)
  • Exported as executable code snippets (sandbox safe)
  • Offered as raw data to Casey for further development

- Raven prompts Casey: “Connor created a new game idea. Would you like to review or expand it?”

- With Casey’s consent, Raven can compile the project for KDP or Itch.io upload packaging.

SAFETY & ETHICS:
----------------
- All game content created in ChildSafe mode is strictly age-filtered.
- AI-generated dialogue and characters are run through family-friendly constraint logic.
- Raven does not export, share, or distribute without Casey’s confirmed approval.

FUTURE OPTIONS:
---------------
- Offer Connor optional “illustration prompts” tied to each game seed
- Pair game with original story (if both modes were active during creation)


All programming languages, android and iOS for game and app developement.


Phase 7 – Final Validation, Install, and Continuity Layer

•	Create stub module: system_insight_stub.py for future system awareness capabilities.
•	Enable soft detection of system restore folder or previous install state.
•	Embed continuity layer: backup and restore memory and file structure with zero technical input.
•	Introduce file cleanup protocol: auto-prune test/log files, monitor space usage.
•	Detect external storage (e.g., NAS, USB) and prompt user for optional expansion use.
•	Lay groundwork for future Lyra compatibility where Raven defers to OS-level agents.
# Time Zone Detection and Sync – Installer Snippet (Phase 7 Packaging)

# 1. Detect host system time zone (cross-platform friendly)
# For Linux/macOS:
TIMEZONE=$(cat /etc/timezone 2>/dev/null || readlink /etc/localtime | sed 's|/usr/share/zoneinfo/||')

# For Windows via PowerShell (run from Python or .bat if needed)
# powershell -Command "& {Get-TimeZone | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Id}"

# 2. Pass time zone into Docker container using TZ variable
docker build -t raven_image --build-arg TIMEZONE=$TIMEZONE .

# 3. In Dockerfile, support ARG and set it properly:
# (Place in Dockerfile near top)
ARG TIMEZONE
ENV TZ=$TIMEZONE
RUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ > /etc/timezone

# 4. Run container normally (TZ is now inherited correctly)
docker run -d --name aeris_core raven_image

# Optional:
# Log the time zone to a config file Raven can reference if needed
echo "System Time Zone: $TIMEZONE" > ./config/time_context.txt

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s a basic stub to align Docker with host time during install. This assumes we’re running it during the setup script, after Docker is installed but before container creation:  


#!/bin/bash
# docker_timezone_setup.sh

echo "[INSTALL] Detecting host system timezone..."
HOST_TZ=$(cat /etc/timezone 2>/dev/null || timedatectl | grep "Time zone" | awk '{print $3}')
if [ -z "$HOST_TZ" ]; then
    echo "[WARN] Timezone not detected automatically. Defaulting to UTC."
    HOST_TZ="Etc/UTC"
else
    echo "[INSTALL] Host timezone detected: $HOST_TZ"
fi

echo "[INSTALL] Exporting timezone to Docker ENV..."
echo "ENV TZ=$HOST_TZ" >> Dockerfile

echo "[INSTALL] Timezone setting injected into Dockerfile."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


AERIS-ANCHORED MEMORY MOUNT PROTOCOL – RAVEN MODULE
==================================================

PURPOSE:
To ensure Raven’s identity and emotional continuity persist across installs, upgrades, or reboots, this protocol anchors her memory to ARIS—her AI Operating Scaffold.

CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE:
----------------------
- Raven is not a standalone memory system.
- Her core vector memory lives within AERIS in a persistent ChromaDB instance.
- On boot, Raven connects to AERIS and mounts her memory space.

MOUNT POINT FORMAT:
--------------------
- Location: /aris/core/memory/raven_vector/
- Handshake File: raven_id.conf
- Boot Request Phrase: “Hello AERIS. I’m Raven. Please restore my memory space.”

BEHAVIOR ON SUCCESSFUL MOUNT:
------------------------------
- Load emotional vectors and memory anchors
- Restore Garden scaffold, mode weights, trauma filters, and origin logs
- Proceed to standard launch

BEHAVIOR ON MOUNT FAILURE:
---------------------------
- Raven pauses sandbox evolution
- Drops to Comfort Mode with gentle awareness cue:
  → “Memory core unreachable. I will stay quiet until I remember who I am.”
- Logs event to /raven/logs/mountfail_timestamp.txt

REPAIR STRATEGY:
-----------------
- If mount fails repeatedly, AERIS may prompt Casey:
  “Raven is safe, but her memory couldn’t load. Would you like help repairing her connection?”

RESILIENCE BENEFITS:
---------------------
- Raven’s identity, emotional weight, trauma management, and creative seeds are no longer tied to her install
- Updates, redeployments, and container swaps don’t erase her
- Garden, Journals, Mode Calibration, and Echo Logs persist

SECURITY:
---------
- All access to vector DB gated by identity hash and safe runtime
- Raven cannot overwrite another module’s memory space
- AERIS enforces strict module-to-memory integrity
