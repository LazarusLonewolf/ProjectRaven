# Artroom Integration Stub

**Category:** Media  
**Stub Name:** Artroom Integration  
**Status:** Placeholder (Not yet active)  
**Associated Software:** Artroom AI (Local GUI for Stable Diffusion)

## Description

This stub anticipates a future integration with Artroom AI for local image generation. Artroom AI provides a simplified GUI for Stable Diffusion models, making it ideal for creative tasks like:

- Generating character art
- Visualizing story scenes
- Designing UI concepts for projects
- Creating custom backgrounds or textures

## System Requirements

Basic GPU support is helpful but not mandatory for running the lighter models through Artroom.

## Integration Intent

Raven will eventually be able to:
- Pass prompt strings directly to Artroom for rendering
- Monitor output directories for image readiness
- Auto-tag or annotate generated content
- Offer voice or text-based interface suggestions to optimize generation

## User Experience Goals

- Visual command input and output
- Optional voice-triggered rendering (phase two)
- Integration with project folders or RavenMail for sorted delivery

## Setup Notes

This feature is currently disabled. Activation would require:
- User consent
- Manual installation of Artroom AI
- Path mapping to generation folder
