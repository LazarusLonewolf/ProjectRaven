Tutorial Mode Design for Raven

Overview:
Tutorial Mode is toggleable support that delivers low-friction guidance throughout Raven's system. It exists to teach, not interrupt.

Activation:

Toggled on/off manually by user.

Engages system-wide (except Intimacy Mode, unless actively entered).

Raven still tracks best practices passively, even if tutorial mode is off.

Behavior:

Insight notes appear as side-footnotes, not in-convo derailments.

Offers tips, command hints, efficiency suggestions, and recommendations.

Examples: “To optimize this process, you might try…” or “There’s a faster way to access that by…”

Customization:

Can eventually allow user-tuned frequency or note-pinning.

Intended to reduce guesswork, support recall, and reinforce mastery.
