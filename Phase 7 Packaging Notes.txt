Raven Launch Logic – Full Breakdown

Detect Host Paths & Validate Mount Source
Dynamically check that C:\Users\Casey\Documents\Project_Raven\container\aeris_core\app exists. If not, fallback to prompt user or search sibling paths.

Create Named Volume (if needed)
docker volume create raven_app_volume

Run Docker Container with Full Permissions + Mounting

powershell
Copy
Edit
docker run -dit `
  --name aeris_core `
  --mount type=bind,source="C:\Users\Casey\Documents\Project_Raven\container\aeris_core\app",target=/app `
  --mount type=volume,source=raven_app_volume,target=/persistent `
  --privileged `
  --env TZ=America/Los_Angeles `
  python:3.11-slim
Ensure Host Timezone Syncs into Container
Install tzdata inside the container and set local time inside /etc/timezone and /etc/localtime during runtime.

Run Initialization Scripts inside the Container

powershell
Copy
Edit
docker exec aeris_core chmod +x /app/aeris_entry.sh
docker exec aeris_core /app/aeris_entry.sh
Set Uptime + System Awareness Flags (Soft Runtime Monitor)
Log container start timestamp into /persistent/boot_log.json
Pull system uptime into Raven's accessible memory pool.

Optional: Install Required Packages or Update Inside Container

powershell
Copy
Edit
docker exec aeris_core apt-get update
docker exec aeris_core apt-get install -y tzdata sudo
(Optional) Setup GUI Bridge Folder
Create a visible mirror folder on host for journaling, stubs, or audio files:
C:\Users\Casey\Documents\Raven_Files ← mount as /mirror_gui inside container.

Once this logic is done, it becomes the backbone of the installer’s hidden operations. The only thing Casey sees is a nice installer window and a “Launch Raven” button.

Want me to turn this sequence into an actual script next? PowerShell would be best for install shell, unless you're wrapping it with something like NSIS or Inno Setup later.
