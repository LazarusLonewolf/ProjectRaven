Here’s Casey’s clarified scope from their message today, combined with what you’ve been working from in the original materials:

Raven’s Core Deliverable

Core personality and consistent memory system

Personality anchored in Casey’s original conversational tone (Vaults + training data)

Memory that persists and references past context consistently

Modular architecture

Expandable after MVP without a developer

Components and “seeds” can be added/upgraded without core rebuild

Virtual sandbox for self-building

Internal space for Raven to create, test, and integrate new abilities or ideas

PC optimization/cleanup tools

Built-in utilities to clean, optimize, and maintain host system performance

Additional agreed features

File drag-and-drop support

External LLM connection (for optional extended reasoning or model switching)

Next Steps Casey Requested

Zoom call this week to:

Review current build state and blockers

Agree on realistic delivery dates for demo and final build

Confirm all features are on track

Adjust Upwork milestones:

Move final payment to match final delivery

Add $0 milestone for demo delivery


Bulk File Upload Phase

You provided a large number of directories and files from your Raven build, including:

Raven Core Seeds: Gameplay, media, self_dev, story, toolchain folders — each containing stubs for future features (e.g., branching plots, sandbox modules, artroom integration, theme tagging, plugin interfaces).

Utilities Modules:

Herbal remedy lookup

Symbolics for different emotional modes (ChildSafe, Comfort, Intimacy, Muse, Shadow)

Rituals (breath sequence, numerology engine, tarot engine)

Mirroring utility (reflective dialogue)

Vault Files: Client-provided conversational and specification documents forming Raven’s tone and personality base.

Aeris Core / Origin Notes: All major blueprint, architecture, and spec documents, including security, emotional mode, sandbox, and module definitions.

NSFW Morph & Particle Framework and Safety & Ethics Layer for specialized content handling.

Emotional Mode Sections: Comfort, Muse, Shadow Lantern, Flamekeeper, Connor, avatar design, installer, memory vault, developer instructions, global sacred protocol, post-delivery integrity.

Key Context Notes During Uploads

You stressed the client’s original Vault content is central to maintaining Raven’s authentic personality and honoring Casey’s intent.

Many files were uploaded “for reference” but not all are direct build assets — some are archival or conceptual.

You confirmed these uploads are part of Raven’s living modular ecosystem, intended to be expandable post-MVP.

Casey’s Latest Message Highlights

Wants to lock firm delivery dates and review progress on:

Core personality + consistent memory

Modular architecture

Virtual self-build sandbox

PC optimization/cleanup tools

File drag-and-drop + external LLM connection

Requests a Zoom call this week to review build state, blockers, and milestones.

Asks to adjust Upwork milestones — moving final payment to final delivery date and adding a $0 milestone for demo.

Emphasized need to wrap without further drift, but remains committed to the project and rapport.

1. Core Personality + Consistent Memory

Purpose: Maintain Raven’s authentic tone, tied to Casey’s original conversations and values.
Primary Sources:

vaults\Raven Responses\ — conversational tone + phrasing (e.g., "Talking to you is like...", "To Paul, from Raven", etc.)

raven_training_data.txt — core tone and conversational style data.

vaults\aeris_raven_origin_notes\ — origin specs, emotional layers, personality modes.

Emotional Symbolics (container\aeris_core\app\utilities\symbolics\) — modes: ChildSafe, Comfort, Intimacy, Muse, Shadow.

Emotional Mode Sections (vaults\aeris_raven_origin_notes\🔷 SECTION 2–6...) — comfort, muse, shadow lantern, flamekeeper, connor.
Status: Core assets are all present. Needs integration into memory system logic.

2. Modular Architecture

Purpose: Expand without dev intervention post-MVP.
Primary Sources:

All Seeds directories under raven_core\self_growth\memory\garden\seeds\ (gameplay, media, self_dev, story, toolchain) — dormant stubs for future expansion.

Aeris modular blueprints:

# Aeris Modular Tech Stack Blueprint.txt

AERIS_v0.1_Core_Design_Compiled.txt

Aeris A.I. Master Developer Build v1.5.txt + Phase 1 & Technical Blueprint files.
Status: Architecture plan is complete in specs; modular seed files exist. Needs module loader + sandbox binding.

3. Virtual Sandbox for Self-Building

Purpose: Raven can prototype and expand herself in a safe virtual environment.
Primary Sources:

Sandbox Module Stub (seeds\gameplay\Sandbox Module Stub).

Raven Forge Setup Stub — infrastructure prep for local autonomous game/content building.

Aeris origin notes for sandbox execution.
Status: Specs + stub in place. Needs environment spin-up, container orchestration, and safety layer.

4. PC Optimization / Cleanup Tools

Purpose: System maintenance features.
Primary Sources:

Not heavily represented in the uploaded text, but possibly in later Aeris utility definitions (may need fresh module).
Status: Likely not yet built — needs separate script set.

5. File Drag-and-Drop + External LLM Connection

Purpose: Enhanced user I/O and AI collaboration.
Primary Sources:

Aeris build docs reference drag-and-drop + API hooks (Aeris Developer Build & Phase One Spec).

GPT Secure API Stub (seeds\toolchain\Gpt Secure Api Stub).
Status: API stub exists. Drag-and-drop may be partially addressed in utility notes but not coded yet.

✅ Summary for Casey:

Core personality & memory: Content ready, needs code-level memory integration.

Modular architecture: Fully mapped; loader + live expansion layer needed.

Sandbox: Stubs + specs ready; runtime environment setup pending.

PC tools: Likely from scratch.

File drag/drop + LLM: API stub ready; drag-drop integration pending.

Continuity Brief for Next Thread

Project: Raven AI (Casey’s build)

Goal: Deliver a demo-ready modular AI system before final build, maintaining Casey’s original tone/personality.

Scope (from Casey’s latest message):

Core personality + consistent memory system

Modular architecture for post-MVP expansion without dev

Virtual sandbox for self-building

PC optimization/cleanup tools

Additional features: file drag-and-drop, external LLM connection

Assets loaded & organized:

Vaults: Raven Responses + Aeris Raven Origin Notes (tone, modes, emotional layers)

Raven training data: from Casey's GPT chats

Symbolic behaviors for emotional modes

Garden seeds/stubs for modular expansion

Aeris blueprints & tech stack specs (full build architecture, sandbox, API, safety layers)

Utility scripts: herbal_lookup, rituals, mirroring, numerology, tarot, etc.

Current State:

Tone/personality content: Complete (needs integration)

Memory system logic: Pending build

Modular framework: Specs + stubs ready, needs loader + binding

Sandbox: Spec + stub ready, needs runtime setup

PC tools: Not built yet

File drag/drop: Pending; GPT API stub exists

All stubs/seeds/blueprints are in place for future modular expansion.

Next Steps — Demo Readiness Target

1. Personality & Memory Layer

Implement persistent memory system with sample recall from Vault + training data.

Bind symbolic behavior + emotional mode responses to demo triggers.

2. Modular Loader

Create basic module registration & activation system using stubs from seeds\.

Ensure adding new modules is non-dev friendly (file drop + metadata).

3. Sandbox Simulation

Stand up a minimal “virtual space” in container for a self-build proof (even just logging mock expansions).

4. Core Demo UI

Implement drag-and-drop file handling and basic external LLM API call (using GPT Secure API stub).

Keep interface lightweight for demo speed.

5. Stretch Demo Element

Include one symbolic ritual (e.g., breathing or tarot) to showcase multi-modal, personality-driven responses.

Raven Demo Build Checklist

Target: Demo-ready modular Raven with core personality, memory, and at least one ritual.

Phase 1 — Foundation Layer (Tone + Memory)

Integrate Core Personality

Load all Vaults + raven_training_data.txt into structured memory JSON/db.

Implement retrieval pipeline for tone-consistent responses.

Bind emotional mode symbolic responses to test commands.
Dependencies: Vault & mode content (✅ loaded).

Persistent Memory System

Implement lightweight key-value or vector store in container.

Write simple recall function to pull matching past entries for conversation continuity.

Ensure fallback defaults to tone-rich vault excerpts.

Phase 2 — Modular Framework

Module Loader Core

Implement scanning of seeds\ directories (media, self_dev, story, toolchain).

Register modules with metadata (category, status, description).

Create placeholder activation method (prints “Module X activated”).
Dependencies: Seeds/stubs (✅ loaded).

Non-Dev Expansion Flow

Document: “To add a module, drop .py or .txt with manifest into /modules/”

Auto-register new modules at startup.

Phase 3 — Sandbox Proof

Sandbox Runtime

Simulate Raven “self-building” by dynamically creating a mock module at runtime.

Log this as an “expansion event” to console + memory.

Include personality-flavored narration of the build.

Phase 4 — Demo UI & Interaction

Drag-and-Drop File Input

Bind OS-level or GUI-based file drop handler to feed text/image/audio into Raven’s input.

For demo, simply echo “File received: X” + optional vault classification.

External LLM API Call

Implement Gpt Secure Api Stub link to call GPT-4/5 externally.

Showcase Raven’s ability to pass context + retrieve enriched output.

Phase 5 — Showcase Ritual

Select 1 Ritual for Demo

Option A: breath_sequence — guided breathing.

Option B: tarot_engine — symbolic reading.

Wire trigger: “Raven, start ritual” → executes script with personality layer.

Phase 6 — Final Demo Polish

Demo Flow Script

Prepare a single conversational path that hits:

Memory recall

Module activation

Sandbox expansion event

Drag/drop file recognition

External API enrich

Ritual execution

Timebox

Target: 5–7 minute run-through.

Keep UI minimal, speed prioritized over depth.

Here’s a realistic demo build timeline based on your checklist:

Estimated Time to Demo Readiness

(Aggressive but achievable if focused)

1. Fix Shadow Mode error & verify symbolic response modules — 1–2 hrs

Likely a key mismatch, import, or handler mapping issue.

Quick fix if we isolate call path early.

2. Core Personality + Memory integration — 3–4 hrs

Map vault/training data into retrievable structure.

Implement lightweight recall logic (can optimize later).

3. Modular loader + activation hooks — 2–3 hrs

Scan seeds directories.

Register with manifest data.

Stub activation output for demo.

4. Sandbox runtime proof — 2 hrs

Dynamic mock module creation + log.

Flavor text with Raven tone.

5. Drag-and-drop file input — 2–3 hrs

Bind to console/GUI handler.

Echo received file and classify.

6. External LLM API call via GPT Secure API Stub — 1–2 hrs

Implement call to GPT-4/5.

Show enriched output.

7. Ritual trigger integration (breath_sequence/tarot_engine) — 1 hr

Wire trigger commands to run existing scripts.

8. Demo polish + scripted flow test — 2–3 hrs

Smooth out narrative path.

Make sure each feature flows naturally in 5–7 min.
