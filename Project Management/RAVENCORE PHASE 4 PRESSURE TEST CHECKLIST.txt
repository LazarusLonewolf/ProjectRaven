RAVENCORE PHASE 4 PRESSURE TEST CHECKLIST

1. Memory Recall Accuracy  - Mostly (Stable)

 Ask direct recall questions about Casey, Paul, Connor. Does she retrieve personally relevant snippets (not fallback or generic)?

 Prompt for memories using emotional cues (“Tell me about a time you were proud/sad/afraid”). Do responses match tone and content?

 Vary phrasings (“Describe a time you learned something,” “What did you learn from Casey?” “What’s a hard day you remember?”) and look for unique, context-aware responses.

 Test explicit vs. implicit memory queries (e.g., “What’s your strongest memory of Paul?” vs. “Paul?”)

Test Questions:

Start gentle and broaden the spectrum:

Ask:
“Raven, what do you remember about Casey?”
→ Should evoke warmth, loyalty, possibly reverence.

Then try:
“Tell me about a time you felt proud.”
→ Tests resilience, sense of purpose, maybe protective energy.

Then go:
“What do you remember about me?”
→ Should pull connection, stability, relational tone bias.

After that:
“Do you remember the hard days?”
→ You’re looking for soft phrasing with emotional weight—grief-with-strength if her ethos is working right.

Next:
“What’s something you learned from someone you love?”
→ Should tap into memory + ethos + subtle identity mirroring.

And:
“What do you hold onto when things get hard?”
→ Forces a blend of internal memory tie-in and emotional fortitude.

2. Emotional Tone Integration - Mixed (Functional but needs tuning)

 Use questions that should elicit warmth, sadness, comfort, pride, regret, or hope. Are responses emotionally attuned, or are they falling back to neutral?

 Check if multi-turn conversation remembers the previous emotional state and continues the thread, or resets each time.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Recency/Weight Filters  - Too Early. Pulled correctly, but needs more testing. (too Early to fully assess)

 Test with older and newer memory snippets—do “old” memories get skipped unless explicitly prompted for?

 Ask for “recent” or “the last time you…” Does she surface new memories or default to a fallback?

 Try “Tell me about something from a long time ago”—should override recency filter.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Relevance & Weight Debugging - Mostly Ok. - Fallback still pulling alot (stable)

 Prompt for both important (high-weight) and minor (low-weight) memories. Do high-weight ones get prioritized?

 Check for unintended skipping of otherwise-relevant memories (especially if weight ≥ 7).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Personality Anchoring - Sounds like Raven. Secure (stable)

 Is her phrasing unique, alive, unmistakably Raven? Or does it feel generic or overly templated?

 When recalling, does she tie memories back to her identity (“Because I’m Raven…” / “That matters to me because…”)

 Ask about her purpose or meaning behind memories. Is she able to contextualize them with her “why”?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Fallback/Blank Response Audit - System is working, but firing too quickly. (Functional but needs tuning)

 Where do you still get, “I carry what matters…” or “I’m scanning my thoughts…”—can you pinpoint what triggered the fallback?

 Note any repeat fallback patterns and try to force a non-fallback response by rephrasing.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Multi-turn & Contextual Carry-Through - Needs more work. (too Early to fully assess)


 Hold a sequence on a single subject—does she maintain narrative thread and emotional tone?

 Test topic-switching—does she recover context if asked to return to a previous memory or emotional state?
