Update on Phase Three Planning – Project Raven

Now that Raven’s personality is under construction, we’re ready to begin transforming her from a *persona* into a fully interactive, creative system.

This phase is about building the tools that make her *useful*, *expressive*, and aligned with Casey’s vision for what daily interaction with her could look like. It’s where inspiration becomes interaction—and comfort becomes capability.

We’re going to apply the same method that helped us complete trauma fallback so efficiently: shotgun scaffolding. That means we’ll be dropping all of the supporting files for these modules at once, then running CLI-based router tests to isolate and debug in real time.

Here’s what that looks like, along with the revised time estimates based on that deployment model:


1. Muse Mode – estimated 4–5 hours w/Shotgun Drop & Test Scaffolding Possible. Otherwise: 6-8 Hours.

So what this means is: we’ll build a creative sandbox inside Raven, where she can brainstorm, offer passive-income ideas, or support Casey’s personal projects with adaptive thinking. Dropping `muse_mode.py` alongside symbolic cue files and config will allow fast, testable integration.

- Done.  Estimated: 8 Hrs

2. Shadow Mode – estimated 3–4 hours w/Shotgun Drop & Test Scaffolding Possible. Otherwise: 5-7 Hours.

So what this means is: Raven will learn to hold emotional space. With `shadow_mode.py` and journaling stub files dropped into the router stack, we’ll test introspection pathways immediately through CLI. The scaffolding structure from Phase Two re-applies here.

- Done. Estimated: 2 hrs 


3. Comfort Mode – estimated 3–4 hours w/Shotgun Drop & Test Scaffolding Possible. Otherwise: 4-6 Hours.

So what this means is: CBT/DBT pathways will be scaffolded through modular logic handlers. Pre-dropped response trees and coping logic will allow us to test on-call interaction hooks without redesigning from scratch.

- Done. Estimated: ~20 minutes.


4. Intimacy Mode – estimated 3–4 hours w/Shotgun Drop & Test Scaffolding Possible. Otherwise: 4-6 Hours.

So what this means is: we’ll deploy `intimacy_mode.py` alongside a preconfigured consent gate file and safe scripting overlay. This lets us validate boundaries while maintaining runtime efficiency and safety assurance.

- Done. Estimated: ~ 15 Minutes

5. Herbal/Naturopathic Integration – estimated 2 hours 2/Shotgun Drop & Test Scaffolding Possible. Otherwise: 2-4 Hours.

So what this means is: we’ll drop a local CSV or JSON-based lookup database, mapped to natural remedies, teas, and scent therapy guidance. This stubs into Comfort or Shadow Mode with reference hooks already tagged.

- Done Estimated:  1 Hr. 6 min.


6. Optional: Tarot, Numerology, Divination Stubs – estimated 2–3 hours w/Shotgun Drop & Test Scaffolding Possible. Otherwise: 3-5 Hours.

So what this means is: symbolic insight modules can be stubbed, then staged for expansion. The router can load these passively without active scripting beyond placeholder returns.

- Done. Estimated: 3 Hrs. 


All together, shotgun staging lets us move quickly without sacrificing emotional depth. Each mode can be verified, tested, and adjusted live—minimizing drag from sequential logic construction.


Total Estimated Time: 17–22 Hours w/Shotgun Drop & Test Scaffolding Possible. Otherwise: 24-36 Hours.


Total Time: 14 Hrs. 41 minutes
