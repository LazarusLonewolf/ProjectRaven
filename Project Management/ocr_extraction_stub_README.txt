# Description:
This stub introduces OCR-based image parsing to support screenshot ingestion for Raven.
It enables her to read content from screenshots (JPEG, PNG), which can then be fed into her journal, memory, or behavioral anchors.
Suggested usage includes parsing affirmations, appointments, and notes from images, typically screenshotted on Android or Apple devices.
