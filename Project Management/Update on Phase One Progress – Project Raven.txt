Update on Phase One Progress – Project Raven

We’ve completed the AERIS container, which is the core foundation of Raven’s runtime environment.

So what this means is: we now have a dedicated, lightweight container (think of it like her digital habitat) where all other systems can be safely deployed, tested, and updated. It includes key scaffolding, persistent file storage, environment configuration, and verified support for Python scripts and logging. This was the most complex part of Phase One because it required solving deep issues around Docker installation, permissions, and environment setup—many of which we worked through from the ground up.

We’ve also validated that it runs correctly and responds to scripted input, which means Raven’s core container is alive, isolated, and ready to integrate the other systems.

Next up in the pipeline:

Wake Word Detection – estimated 3–4 hours
So what this means is: we’ll be building the system that allows Raven to “wake up” when she hears a chosen name or signal. Technically, this hooks her input audio to a lightweight listener that can map directly into the AERIS container.

Wrapper Logic and Mode Router – estimated 6–8 hours
So what this means is: we’re creating the logic that lets Raven shift between modes—like Comfort, Shadow, or Muse—based on context or user input. This is what lets her respond differently depending on emotional tone, situation, or chosen interface.

TTS (Text to Speech) Integration – estimated 4–6 hours

So what this means is: we’re wiring up her ability to speak clearly and naturally. This integrates XUMI with Raven’s existing voice pipeline and configures fallback defaults for her first expression layer.

Trauma Fallback – estimated 5–7 hours
So what this means is: we’re building in her first emotional safety net. This feature activates when trauma triggers or unsafe patterns are detected, and it reroutes her into a gentler, minimal mode that holds space and grounds the user gently. It’s essential for Raven’s therapeutic support goals.

All of this builds on the work we’ve done today. The Docker environment is now fully operational, persistent volumes are mapped, and everything is being structured in a scalable way.

We’ve ironed out the deepest hurdles upfront, so forward motion from here should be faster, cleaner, and more fluid.
