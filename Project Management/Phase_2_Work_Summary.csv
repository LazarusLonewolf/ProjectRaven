Ingest all 40+ Raven memory files,Continuous Effort,Continuous Effort,Ongoing,Continuous background effort across Phase Two; not tracked as discrete task. Became interwoven into tone and symbolic scripting work.
Parse emotional tone from Casey’s writing,Continuous Effort,Continuous Effort,Ongoing,"Performed concurrently with tone, symbolic behaviors, and voice scaffolding. Influenced all mode designs."
"Construct five persona modes (Comfort, Muse, Shadow, Intimacy, Child-Safe)",10 hours,5–6 hours,8 hours,"Longer than scaffolding estimate due to intense validation, tone-matching, and emotional anchoring per mode."
Create symbolic behaviors per mode,6 hours,3–4 hours,1 hour,Heavily accelerated due to symbolic scaffolds and copy-modify pattern reuse across all five modes.
Tone-to-TTS mapping,4 hours,2 hours,Less than 20 minutes,Pre-planned routing and code snippet reuse from comfort mode made it nearly plug-and-play.
Emotional continuity scripting across sessions,8 hours,N/A,Less than 2 hours,Finalized faster due to early-mode memory hooks and a shared emotional session tracking utility.
