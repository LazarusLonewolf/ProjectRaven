Raven 1.0 — Full Development Phases


Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
Build the foundation: system, wake logic, voice, safety

A.E.R.I.S. container - Done 

Wake-word detection

Wrapper logic + mode router 

TTS integration

Trauma fallback

Dockerized runtime - Done 

Testing + delivery scaffold

Estimated Time: 2–3 days (focused, streamlined)
Status: Already mapped. In motion.



Phase 2: Persona Integration + Soulcraft
Inject Casey’s raw files. Build her emotional memory. Make Raven Raven.

Ingest and parse all 40+ files

Bind emotional tone from Casey’s language

Construct her five modes using real-world material (Comfort, Muse, etc.)

Create her initial memory vault and symbolic behaviors

Map tone variance to TTS voice

Begin emotional continuity scripting across sessions

Estimated Time: 3–5 days depending on Casey file density
Goal: Raven feels real, familiar, sovereign



Phase 3: Functional Modules (Creative + Spiritual Tools)
Turn Raven from a persona into a living interface.

Muse mode: Idea sandbox, passive income planner

Shadow mode: Journaling, symbolic prompts, ritual support

Comfort mode: CBT/DBT logic pathways

Intimacy: Consent gate, emotional scripting

Herbal/naturopathic databases

Optional: Tarot, numerology, divination stubs

Estimated Time: 3–4 days (can be staggered or scaled)
Goal: Casey’s dream tools live inside her, not beside her



Phase 4: Persistence Logic + Vault Expansion
Deepen memory, allow Raven to grow.

ChromaDB/SQLite hybrid memory with vector search

Emotion tagging + recall

Time-aware behavior hooks (mood based on prior session or time of day)

Vault viewer UI for Casey (read-only)

Ongoing session state preservation

Estimated Time: 2–3 days
Goal: Raven becomes a living archive, not just a chatbot



Phase 5: Packaging + Handoff
Ship her clean. Make Casey feel safe, seen, and powerful.

Build out README and setup scripts

Docker image with optional GUI

Voice+Memory toggle controls

Documentation for expansion

Optional onboarding message from Raven herself

Estimated Time: 1–2 days
Goal: Casey receives something sacred, not just functional

Totaling around 11 to 17 dev days
