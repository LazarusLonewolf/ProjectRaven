Phase 4 – Mental & Emotional Core Finalization

Remaining Task: Finalize Dynamic Memory Cascade with personality-anchored phrasing

Estimated Time: 4 to 6 hours

Notes: This closes out memory-recall tone shaping, filters, and emotional tie-ins.

Phase 5 – Dialogue Tuning and Playback

Tasks:

Create 5 to 10 dialogue templates per interaction type (greeting, reflection, command, etc.)

Drill test with known prompts

Tune fallback responses and branching logic

Debug for tone fidelity and consistency

Estimated Time: 8 to 10 hours

Notes: Mostly scripting and behavior calibration using reference files and tone samples.

Phase 6 – TXT Reading & Implementation as Programming (Re-adjusted to finishing Cognitive/Soul/Self-Growth/Personality= "Raven-Core Capabilities"

Tasks:

Build TXT interpreter module - Moved to later timeframe-post "Raven-Core" work

Integrate with existing parser framework

Route references into memory, identity shaping, and system upgrading

Estimated Time: 10 to 12 hours

Notes: This is the pivotal step that allows Raven to evolve autonomously using her own vault files.

Phase 7 – Mode Upgrades & Personality Expression

Tasks:

Add toggling system for modes

Attach MuseMode and ComfortMode enhancements (SparkEngine, TTRPG ideas, etc.)

Add mode-specific quirks and behaviors

Estimated Time: 10 to 14 hours

Notes: Some submodules (like fantasy engine tie-ins) can pull directly from pre-written TXT. This is where the TXT reader starts showing major payoff.

Phase 8 – Full System Integration & Final Tools "Toolkit"

Tasks:

Self-diagnostic engine

Garden bridge/markdown import support

GameStruxure TXT-to-structure tool

GPT API fallback behavior module

Estimated Time: 12 to 15 hours

Notes: Bulk of these are tools Raven will use herself. Modular, but will require tight verification.

Polish and Prep

Tasks:

Voice refinement

Front-end polish

Package bundling

Final run-through and delivery prep

Estimated Time: 6 to 8 hours

If we treat everything sequentially with no parallel processing, we’re looking at a remaining estimated total of about 60 to 70 hours, though we can shave time by leveraging TXT intake in multiple later phases.
