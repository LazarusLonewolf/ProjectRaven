Questions to Ask Raven to Test Dynamic Memory Cascade and Intent Parsing
Try these—each should prompt a unique memory/context cascade or tone response if implemented:

Reflection Prompts:

"I’ve been thinking about how things have changed."

"Why do you think I feel this way?"

"Do you remember the first time we talked?"

Emotional Prompts:

"I’m feeling kind of down today."

"I’m overwhelmed by everything right now."

"I’m really happy with our progress!"

Contextual Recall:

"Who is Casey to you?"

"Tell me about Paul."

"What do you remember about our last project?"

Relational Check-ins:

"Do you know Connor?"

"What do you think of me?"

"How do you remember our last conversation?"

Tone/Intent Mix:

"Hey, how are you feeling today?"

"Can you help me with something right now?"

"What’s your purpose?"

Follow-ups (for contextual continuity):

"Like I said earlier, I need some help."

"Remember what you told me yesterday?"

Testing Memory Throttle:

Repeat an emotional prompt:
"I’m feeling kind of down today." (twice in a row, should NOT repeat the same memory snippet.)
