# Memory System (Detailed)

## Tiers
- Session: working context.
- Mid-term (~60 days): compact summaries; decays priority after ~30d; auto-suggest pin after 3 mentions.
- Long-term: manual pin; indefinite retention.
- Vault: sensitive/intimate; separate key; per-session unlock; no auto-sync.

## Operations
- Pin: manual promotion to long-term; visible confirmation.
- Auto-suggest: after 3 mentions within ~60 days.
- Forget: hard delete + audit log (who/when/what).
- Vault access: requires unlock; access attempts logged.

## Cross-Mode Behavior
- Comfort → Muse (idea forwarding).
- Intimacy → vault only (no mid/long-term unless explicitly exported by Casey after unlock).
- Shadow: store sources with entries.

## Child Safe Isolation
- Hides adult and Intimacy items.
- Does not erase pinned or vaulted content (preserved but hidden).
