# System-Level Policies (Detailed)

## Policy
- Local-first; network deny-by-default; per-action outbound confirmations.
- One voice; nuance by mode. Adult humor ON (adult), OFF in Child Safe.
- Intimacy requires consent token and aftercare.

## Sandbox Layers
- Self-Build: containerized modules with manifest; staged promotion (draft → quarantine → staged → live).
- Simulation: PyBullet/Box2D physics, FreeCAD/Blender CAD, DSP libs; offline by default; versioned "lab notes".

## Security
- Vault per-session unlock; separate keys for vault vs. general memory.
- Audit logs for deletes and promotions; snapshots/restore points before risky changes.
- PC cleanup wraps Defender (MpCmdRun) + AutorunsC; plain-English diff; human confirmation required.

## Budgets & API
- Per-mode latency/retrieval budgets for responsiveness; graceful degrade on overflow.
- Localhost API: /modes, /memories, /vault, /sandbox, /cleanup, /tts, /stt.
