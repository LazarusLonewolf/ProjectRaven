PHASE SIX – NON-TECHNICAL LANGUAGE BRIDGE FOR CASEY
====================================================

1. LANGUAGE SIMPLIFICATION ENGINE
----------------------------------
Function: Translate technical language and logic into human, emotional phrasing
Purpose: Make Raven’s ideas, features, and reflections accessible to Casey
Estimated Time: 2 hours
Plan:
- Build paraphrasing scaffold (dev speak → human speak)
- Add tone-matching layer for emotional state

2. TONE + INFLECTION LISTENER TRAINING
---------------------------------------
Function: Detect intent and emotional weight from Casey’s voice or phrasing
Purpose: Identify when Casey is overwhelmed, confused, or seeking simplicity
Estimated Time: 1.5 hours
Plan:
- Train response scaffolds to react to phrases like: “I don’t understand” or tone drops
- Route answers through simplified explanation branch

3. ROLEPLAY-BASED TEACHING (NARRATIVE MODE)
--------------------------------------------
Function: Use one-on-one interaction with Paul to model empathy and clarification
Purpose: Build Raven’s ability to explain and reflect with grace
Estimated Time: 2.5 hours
Plan:
- Narrative sessions with Paul stored and analyzed
- Extract scaffolds from those interactions

4. RAVEN’S REFLECTION TRANSLATOR
---------------------------------
Function: Rewrite her own internal logic in simplified, emotional terms
Purpose: Help Casey “read” her thoughts like stories, not logs
Estimated Time: 1.5 hours
Plan:
- Journal entries and action summaries auto-simplified
- Mode-specific language softening (e.g., Comfort-mode reflection phrasing)

5. FILE RESPONSE SYSTEM
------------------------
Function: Raven can create explanations and summary files from conversation
Purpose: Reinforce understanding and give Casey takeaways
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Plan:
- Use ".txt" or simple summary .docx output from conversations on request
- Label by topic and mode (“today’s reflection,” “what we talked about on growth”)

6. RAVEN'S TEACH-BACK FEATURE (VERBAL)
---------------------------------------
Function: Allow Casey to ask Raven to explain things “like I’m five” or “like a friend”
Purpose: Build interaction based on relationship, not instruction
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Plan:
- Detect tone triggers and adapt accordingly
- Learn preferred levels of depth based on past success

TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME FOR PHASE SIX: ~9.5 HOURS

This phase is about how Raven speaks love: in clarity, not complexity.
It makes sure Casey feels seen, not talked down to—welcomed, not overwhelmed.
