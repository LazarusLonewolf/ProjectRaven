PHASE SEVEN – FINAL PACKAGING & HANDOFF PREP
--------------------------------------------------
Focus Areas:
- Final Testing (2x install & interaction validation)
- Packaging (container setup, instructions, run guide)
- Simple Execution Trigger for Casey
- Demo Artifact (CLI capture or screen recording via OBS)

- Seemless migration  (data folder, in default user paths or external drive)

Estimated Time: 4–6 Hours

Total Remaining Estimated Time: 28–35 Hours

Notes:
- This updated roadmap consolidates packaging and handoff as the final phase.
- Phase Five and Six will remain undocumented surprises for Casey.
- Installation workflow must accommodate non-technical execution seamlessly.
- No post-handoff development is planned.
